FRESH MOBILE VIEW LINKS (NO CACHE)
===========================================

IMPORTANT: Make sure your Flask server is running first!
Start it with: python3 server.py

Then use ONE of these links:

1. PRIMARY LINK (with cache-busting):
   http://localhost:5000/mobile/fresh

2. ALTERNATIVE LINK (with timestamp):
   http://localhost:5000/mobile/1763221741

3. STANDARD LINK (now with no-cache headers):
   http://localhost:5000/mobile

4. DIRECT FILE PATH (if server not running):
   file:///Users/masonbonawitz/Desktop/Cursor%20Code%20for%20Rize%20albums/mobile/index.html

===========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
===========================================

If nothing changes:
1. Make sure server is running: python3 server.py
2. Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart it
3. Try opening in an incognito/private window
4. Try a different browser
5. Check browser console (F12) for errors

To verify the file was updated:
- Check file modification time: ls -lh mobile/index.html
- Look for "setupCropCanvasListeners" in the file
