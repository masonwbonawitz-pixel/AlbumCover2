# 🔄 How to Open a Second Terminal Window

## The Problem
When you press `Command + Space` and type "Terminal" again, it just switches to the Terminal you already have open. You need to open a **NEW** window.

## Solution: Open a New Terminal Window

### Method 1: From Terminal Menu (Easiest!)

1. **Click on your Terminal window** (make sure it's active)
2. **Look at the top menu bar** (where it says "Terminal", "File", "Edit", etc.)
3. **Click "Shell"** in the menu bar
4. **Click "New Window"** (or press `Command + N`)
5. **A new Terminal window opens!**

### Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut

1. **Click on your Terminal window** (make sure it's active)
2. **Press:** `Command + N`
3. **A new Terminal window opens!**

### Method 3: New Tab (Also Works!)

1. **Click on your Terminal window** (make sure it's active)
2. **Press:** `Command + T`
3. **A new tab opens** (you'll see tabs at the top)
4. **This works the same as a new window!**

### Method 4: Right-Click on Terminal Icon

1. **Right-click** (or Control+Click) on the Terminal icon in your dock
2. **Click "New Window"**
3. **A new Terminal window opens!**
