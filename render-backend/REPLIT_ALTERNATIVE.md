2. Sign up (free, no credit card)

## Step 2: Create Repl

1. Click **"Create Repl"**
2. Choose **"Python"**
3. Name it: `rize-albums-backend`
4. Click **"Create Repl"**

## Step 3: Upload Files

1. Drag and drop all files from `render-backend` folder into Replit
2. Or use the upload button

## Step 4: Install Packages

1. In the Replit shell (bottom), run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Step 5: Run

1. Click the **"Run"** button
2. Replit will give you a URL like: `https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co`
